# Challenge Summary

Write a method called fizz buzz tree to determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both.
if the node divisble by 3 we return Fizz
if the node divisble by 5 we return Buzz
if the node divisble by 5 and 3  we return FizzBuzz

## Approach & Efficiency

the approach that I've used in this challenge the foreach loop With complexity : time > O(n) , space > O(n)
