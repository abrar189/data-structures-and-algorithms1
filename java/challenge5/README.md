# Singly Linked List

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.
There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly. We will be implementing a Singly Linked List in this implementation.

## Challenge

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
- create a LinkedList class that has a property of head, and have an insert , includes , tostring methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
big O of time = O(n)
big O of space = O(1)

## API
- insert : adding nodes to the linked list.
- includes : checking for a specific value if it exist in the linked list or not.
- toString : looping through the linked list and adding the values in a String variable to be printed.
