## Trees
An non linear data structure, It is a collection of nodes and edges,General trees consist of the nodes
having any number of child nodes. But in case of binary trees every node can have at the most two child
nodes and There is a unique node called root in trees.

## challenge:
- create Node that have the value and the left child node and the right child node
- create these methods preOrder,inOrder and the postOrder to traverse in the trees
- create Binary Search Tree that is a sub class of the Binary tree with two more methods (Add and contains)

## Approach & Efficiency
the traversing methods has the complexity : O(n) for the space and O(n) for the time
the insert complexity : O(n) for the time and the space
the contains complexity : O(n) for the time and the space
